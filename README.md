# Pancreatic-Tumor-Classification-Segmentation
Pancreatic cancer is lethal due to late detection, making early diagnosis crucial. Manual analysis is slow and error-prone, requiring automation. This project uses EfficientNet for classification and U-Net for segmentation to improve accuracy. AI-driven detection aids healthcare professionals in faster, more reliable diagnoses.
